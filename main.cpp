ALGORITHM:
 
    Step 1.     Start
    Step 2.     Define a class called game
    Step 3.     Declare private members/variables of the game class
    Step 4.     Declare public functions of the game class
    Step 5.     Declare function to play the game
    Step 5.1    Print 10 questions for user to answer
    Step 5.2    Print a message that the game is over
    Step 5.3    Display user's attempted answers
    Step 5.4    Calculate users score
    Step 5.5    Print final score message
    Step 6.     Declare function for main menu options
    Step 7.     Call the class game and create a new game
    Step 8.     Call the new game and start the gameLoop function
    Step 9.     Finish
